v 1.0

some shooting game to start

next points to develop:
  - enemy spawn and path adjustment
  - player asset update (size and shape)
  - enemy asset update (size and shape)
  - fix sound (when highly frequent shooting, sound stops and starts again, acting weird)
  - add more sounds to the game
  - fix cactus shape
  - enlarge the highway
  - restart button not working yet
